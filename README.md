# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone 2023

## HELLO





Welcome to my ePortfolio. My name is Isabel Rodarte; I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science from Southern New Hampshire University. The main objective of creating my ePortfolio is to showcase my abilities, strengths, and knowledge in computer science. The ePortfolio will showcase three artifacts that have been enhanced per category: software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The enhancement per category will take the original artifact and improve it based on course outcomes.

# Professional Self-Assesment

During my computer science journey, I gained valuable skills and learned more in-depth computer science concepts. Some of which are essential and helpful in setting professional goals. 

Course CS-260, Data Structures and Algorithms introduces the importance of data structures and algorithms as they are essential for a program to function. I gained knowledge of the importance of data structures, and without a data structure, it would be challenging to write code, maintain the code, and debug. Data structures reduce redundancy in coding, which is a crucial tool within software development. The value of this course ensures my ability to sort, manage, and store information along with efficient techniques to accomplish any operation on data.

Throughout my coursework in CS-310 Collaborating and Team Projects, I was introduced to git. Before this course, I was unfamiliar with git and its purpose. However, I have learned that git is essential in a collaborating team environment. It allows a git repository to be uploaded openly, which peers can collaborate on. Also, version control is beneficial as it tracks modifications made to the code among peers and reverses mistakes by comparing earlier code versions.
